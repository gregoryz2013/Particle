# Game of Life Repository

Have you ever heard of the Game of Life? If not, then this repository will be incomprehensible to you.  
If you want to know what the Game of Life is, here is the link:  
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This repository is a cellular automaton (on particles).  
I also want to thank the user **ArtemOnigiri**, because this repository is a remake of his project.  
I am very grateful to him. Here is a link to the page with the rules of the partial automaton:  
[Rules of the partial automaton](https://habr.com/ru/articles/442128/)

You can also change the rules of the game, as if studying different worlds, with their own structures.
